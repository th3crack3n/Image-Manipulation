This project was the first second of our first C programming
assignment in Com S 229 at Iowa State University. The assignment
to utilize the structures and library functions from the first
part of the project to create a simple meme generator. Overlaid
text was given in the format of a bitmap font. All information
regarding meme picture, text, and text location was specified in
files of format MEM, FONT, or ACT. MEM files contain information
relating to the specified meme, font, meme image location, and text
location on the image. FONT files contain the font image location
and character dimensions. ACT files contain the information required
to actually create the meme, such as meme image, font type, and
text values to use.
 

CONTENTS
----------------------------------------------------------
makefile
meme.c
simp.h
mem.h
font.h
act.h


meme.c
----------------------------------------------------------
Usage: ./meme file.mem file.act

Uses the specified mem file and act file to execute the
creation of a meme. Makes calls to various libraries to
parse and modify font and meme simp files to create a
single file which is the desired meme.


simp.h
----------------------------------------------------------
This library contains several structures and functions for
handling images. In addition to the functions for loading
and storing images that were present in the first part of
the project, several executables from the first project,
such as crop and overlay functions, have been abstracted
to this library to be used in the new executable meme.


mem.h
----------------------------------------------------------
This library contains the structure and parsing methods for
handling mem files. Each line is parsed according to its
first identifier, collecting the memes, meme image files,
meme text lines, and calls to font.h to parse the font file
into a font object.


font.h
----------------------------------------------------------
This library contains the structure and parsing methods for 
handling font files. Each line is parsed according to its 
first identifier, collecting the font name, font image file, 
and each character of the font's dimensions. The library 
then crops each letter from the specified image file into an
array of letters, or a font.


act.h
----------------------------------------------------------
This library contains the structure and parsing methods for 
handling act files. Each line is parsed according to its first
identifier, collecting the output filename, meme identifier,
font identifier, and the given text strings to place on the
new meme.
